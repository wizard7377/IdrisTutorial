Currently, there is one major tutorial for Idris. It is on the Idris website, and is quite good. 
However, it relies heavily on knowledge of either Haskell or a Haskell like language. 
This tutorial is designed to teach Idris to someone new to the world of function programming, who perhaps is coming from a language like C++ or Rust.
